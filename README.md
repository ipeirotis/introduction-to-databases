## Indicative Schedule

### Module 1: Entity-Relationship Model and Relational Databases

* Entities, Primary Keys, and Attributes
* Relations
* Cardinality: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many
* From ER Diagram to a Relational Schema
* (Optional) SQL Statements for Creating Tables
* (Optional) Populating a Database with Data
* Activity 1: Artist-Gallery-Painting example
* Activity 2: Creating a relational schema from an ER diagram
* Activity 3: From Spreadsheet to a Normalized Database


### Module 2: Selection Queries

* Understand the design of our example databases
* Navigating a Database: `USE`, `SHOW TABLES`, `DESCRIBE`
* Selection queries: `SELECT *`, `SELECT column`, `column AS`, 
* Selection queries: `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`

### Module 3: Filtering Queries

* `WHERE` clause
* Boolean conditions: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `BETWEEN`
* Containment condition: `IN`, 
* Approximate matches: `LIKE`
* `NULL` values
* CASE WHEN clause
* Attribute-level functions: NULL functions, date functions, etc.
* Activity: Find People that Live in "New York" (exploration for data cleaning)
* TODO: Create separate slides for Null Functions, Date Functions, and String functions
* TODO: Create videos for CASE WHEN, Null Functions, Date Functions, String functions

### Module 4: JOIN queries

* Inner Joins
* Self Joins
* Outer Joins
* Antinoins and Semijoins

### Module 5: Aggregate queries

* Aggregation functions (COUNT, COUNT DISTINC, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, STDEV, CONCAT)
* GROUP BY on a single attribute
* GROUP BY on multiple attributes
* HAVING clause
* Integrated JOIN and GROUP BY queries
* TODO: Add an example for GROUP_CONCAT (e.g. for movie genres)
* TODO: In video ["Integrated Queries: Statistics on Directors"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeXWO4xHsTw&list=PLqAPn_b_yx0QcOgEvAKQQ5yzplFI-FOQI&index=42) at sec 37 remove the "For movies from the Year 2000"

### Module 6: Subqueries

* Subqueries with single-value results
* Semijoins and Antijoins using subqueries with the IN clause
* Subqueries with derived tables
* Comparison of WITH, temporary tables, views, and tables
* Activity 1: Music recommendations
* Activity 2: Compare Tastes Across Demographic Segments

### Module 7: Window queries

* Window definition: `OVER(ORDER BY)`
* Ranking window functions: `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, etc
* Aggregation functions and windows `OVER(PARITION BY ORDER BY)`
* Offset window functions: `LEAD`, `LAG` etc
* Aggregation functions and windows
* Frame definitions and rolling aggregations



### Planned modules

* Temporal data (e.g., following https://www.stratascratch.com/guides/sql-time-and-date-skills)
* Geospatial data
* String functions

* UNION
* ANY/ALL
