## Resources

- **[ERD Plus](https://erdplus-old.com/)** — A nice and easy-to-use online tool for creating ERD diagrams  
  *(Note: Please use the old version for now, as the new version cannot convert ER diagrams to relational schemas.)*
- For a more detailed description, read **Chapter 4** (until page 132) from the "Learning MySQL" book.
- **Chapter 6** (until page 207) of "Learning MySQL" describes how to create a database using SQL.
